Install Ruby support in 3 simple steps:

1.
Install KDevPlatform development package (usually called libkdevplatform-devel or similar) or compile KDevPlatform and KDevelop from sources.

2.
Checkout tag for your KDevelop version, for example:
    git checkout kdevelop-4-2
Skip this step if you have KDevelop master installed from sources.

3.
Build and install:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<kde installation directory>
    make
    sudo make install

Notes:
- if KDevelop is installed from distribution packages, installation directory is normally /usr
- if you have self-compiled KDevelop, don't forget to run kbuildsycoca4 after installation
